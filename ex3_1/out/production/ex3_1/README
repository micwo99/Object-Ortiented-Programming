For the creation of the bricks I decide to check what is the distance where i can put bricks
 (remove the board and the space between each bricks) and i divide this distance by the num of bricks i want in each
 line, And i create brick by brick until. if I want want more than one line I grow the Y coordinates after each line

For the creation of the ball I decide to give it a size of 20*20,so the game is harder, if the paddle didn't success to
touch the ball so the ball return at the middle of the window with a random direction.

The creation of my paddle is the userPaddle we create in class, he moves depending on the user(press the arrows)

The GraphicLifeCounter create hearts, which mean how much life I have left, every time the ball touch the bottom of the
window I remove a heart, if I loose the num of hearts I have at the beginning I loose the game.

The NumericLifeCounter informs the user how much life the user have, every time the ball touch the bottom of the
window the number is decremented,if the user loose when he had one life the user loose the game.

I put the hearts and the counter at the same line in the game and in a place that we can see them everytime.
