=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I decide to do two interfaces for Player and Renderer and also two Factories
PlayerFactory and RendererFactory. Those interfaces and factories help us to not rewrite a code severals times and
allows us to have a more readable code

=============================


WhateverPlayer: At every turn of the whatever player I check which cases are empty in our board and the player
chose one of them randomly
CleverPlayer : the clever player (let assume that he plays X),checks in which row and columns there are the more X in a row
and if there is a blank mark in this particular row or column if yes he will put a X in this row randomly between
the blank cases  if there isn't blank cases in the row or the column he will find an other row or columns where
he can put a X.
GeniusPlayer : My genius player is the same that the clever one but I add a defense part,
 which mean that my genius player will check if his opponent have more mark in a row than him if yes,it will try to block
 his opponent, if not he will continue to try to have the more mark in a row
