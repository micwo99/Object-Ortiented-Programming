=====   explanation    ======
=============================
    run complexity:





We convert our image into an Ascii image thanks to many function:
    1)For each character we calculate his brightness level with the help of the function getBrightness
    2)At this state, we have the brightness of all the characters but we want to change all the brightness thanks to
    the function changeBrightness that consist to change the brightness of each character with the equation:
    (charBrightness-minBrightness)/(maxBrightness-minBrightness).
    3)Now we divide the Image depending of the given number of character in row and we check the brightness average of
    the sub-images and we find in our char set which character are the closest of the brightness average of the sub
    image and put it in our new Ascii array and so on.
    4) At the end we receive an 2D array that correspond to the conversion of our image to Ascii.
    Improvement of the complexity:
        when the user enter into the console the command render several times for the same image,without the use of
        hashmap, the function will run each times at O(n), but with the use of an hashmap it allowed us that after the
        first time the user enter render the next times he will enter the command render on the same image the
        complexity time will be O(1) instead of O(n).
